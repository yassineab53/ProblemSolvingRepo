# LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions

Welcome to the **LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions** repository! 🚀

This repository is maintained by **Yassine Abbou** and **Ayoub El Mahjouby**. Here, we collaborate to solve one LeetCode problem every day using **Python** or **Java**. The goal is to enhance our problem-solving skills and strengthen our understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each solution is organized into folders by date and problem name. Inside each folder, you will find:
- A `.py` file for Python solutions (if applicable).
- A `.java` file for Java solutions (if applicable).
- A README.md file describing the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.

### Example Structure:

## ✨ How It Works

1. **Daily Challenge**: Each day, we pick a LeetCode problem to solve.
2. **Solution Implementation**: Each of us solves the problem in Python or Java.
3. **Code Review**: We review each other's solutions to learn and improve.
4. **Push to GitHub**: Both solutions are pushed to this repository with appropriate documentation.
